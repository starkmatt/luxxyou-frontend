# Luxx You - Front End

Here is the base design for Luxx You Silk company.
Initally, we will start of with a place holder conisting of the following.

* Apache Web Server
* HTML Placeholder Page
* CSS Style sheet, for image orientation.


Once the company is ready to launch, we will move to a more recommended design for a webpage using Docker containers, still tossing up the ideas of using EC2 Instances with ECS or going down the Serverless pathway.


To deploy the infrastructure, I've used terraform with 3M Methodology, there was an existing module I've resued but I will need to clean that up old  work and then upload it to this repo.
Will then move the tfstate file into an S3 bucket and utilize GH Actions for CI/CD
