# DEPOT Theme Source Code

This folder contains the main source code from the Depot theme for collaboiration and investigating.
Unfortunately it was difficult to upload in the exact file structure but I will give a diagram of the original file structure below.

Unfortunately the Folder structure of 
```
  Ꝉ css
         ....
```
Was to large to upload individually, so the contents of CSS was part uploaded into this Dir here.
